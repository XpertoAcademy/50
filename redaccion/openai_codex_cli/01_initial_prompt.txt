# GENERAL CONTEXT
OpenAI recently made available Codex CLI, a lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal
Codex CLI is an open‑source command‑line tool that brings the power of our latest reasoning models directly to your terminal. It acts as a lightweight coding agent that can read, modify, and run code on your local machine to help you build features faster, squash bugs, and understand unfamiliar code. Because the CLI runs locally, your source code never leaves your environment unless you choose to share it.
Codex CLI is built for developers who already live in the terminal and want ChatGPT‑level reasoning plus the power to actually run code, manipulate files, and iterate – all under version control. In short, it’s chat‑driven development that understands and executes your repo.
