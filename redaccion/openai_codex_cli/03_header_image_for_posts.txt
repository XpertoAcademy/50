Create a horizontal header image for the instructions thread and posts in Pop Art style, featuring bold black outlines, flat primary colors, Ben-Day dots, and dynamic composition. The scenes use exaggerated expressions, dramatic poses, and comic-style narration boxes with white backgrounds. Inspired by Roy Lichtensteinâ€™s aesthetic, with high-contrast visuals, angular forms, and onomatopoeic accents like WOW!, AMAZING!, and ZAP!
Make sure the entire image falls within the boundaries of the image. Do not add text bubbles or narrative boxes. Only include the title "INSTALLING OPENAI CODEX CLI" and the onomatopoeic accents WOW!, AMAZING!, and ZAP!
