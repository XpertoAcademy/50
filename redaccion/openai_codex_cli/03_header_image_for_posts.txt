Create a horizontal header image for the instructions thread and posts in Pop Art style, featuring bold black outlines, flat primary colors, Ben-Day dots, and dynamic composition. The scenes use exaggerated expressions, dramatic poses, and comic-style onomatopoeic accents like WOW!, AMAZING!, and ZAP!. Inspired by Roy Lichtensteinâ€™s aesthetic, with high-contrast visuals, angular forms. The only text in the image besides the onomatopoeic accents "WOW!", "AMAZING!", and "ZAP!" is the title "INSTALLING OPENAI CODEX CLI". Make sure the entire image fits within the boundaries of the image and is not cut off.
