# REQUEST
Please write a set of tweets for a Twitter thread commenting on OpenAI Codex CLI and for sharing the step by step instructions in English. Start with a tweet that says something like ‚ÄúOpenAI launched Codex CLI, a lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal. Here are step by step instructions for installing it under Windows 11‚Äù, followed by a quick note on what OpenAI Codex CLI is, and then the multiple tweets threads with the instructions below, adjusting its language as you see fit and breaking it into tweets.
Add the instructions and steps for launching the Windows Shell, which I missed including.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Installing OpenAI Codex CLI on Windows 11
To install Codex CLI on Windows 11, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Node.js on Your Computer

The easiest way is to download a prebuilt Node.js Windows Installer from:
üîó https://nodejs.org/en/download
Run the installer ‚Äî it will install Node.js along with the necessary packages and configuration.

To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open Windows PowerShell and run:
node -v
npm -v

### 2. Change Script Execution Policy in PowerShell

Learn more about PowerShell execution policies here:
üîó https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies

Once you're comfortable with what it implies, open Windows PowerShell and run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: You may need to select "Yes" or "Yes to All" to proceed.

### 3. Verify Your Organization in OpenAI

Go to:
üîó https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general
You‚Äôll need to complete digital onboarding ‚Äî have a valid ID (national ID, driver‚Äôs license, or passport) and a working camera (from your computer or phone) ready.

### 4. Add a Payment Method to OpenAI

To activate Codex CLI, OpenAI requires a minimum charge of $5 USD.
Register a credit card here:
üîó https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/payment-methods

### 5. Create or Confirm an Active Project on OpenAI
Ensure you have at least one active project in OpenAI‚Äôs platform:
üîó https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects

### 6. Generate Your OpenAI API Key

Create your API key here:
üîó https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
Copy and store it securely.
‚ÑπÔ∏è OpenAI will not display it again completely.

### 7. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY Environment Variable in PowerShell

Open PowerShell and type:
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
To check that it worked:
echo $env:OPENAI_API_KEY
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: This sets the environment variable only for the current session.

#### To permanently set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable in PowerShell:
You can set it in your PowerShell Profile.
* Check where your profile is stored:
Open Windows PowerShell and type:
echo $PROFILE
* Open it in Notepad or in VSCode (if you have it installed and prefer it):
notepad $PROFILE
code $PROFILE

‚ÑπÔ∏èIf the file doesn‚Äôt exist, it will prompt you to create it ‚Äî accept the prompt.

Then, inside the profile file, add the line:
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
Save the file, close PowerShell, then reopen it and run:
echo $env:OPENAI_API_KEY
You should now see your key permanently available in new PowerShell sessions.

### You‚Äôre Ready to Use Codex CLI!
From here, you can run Codex CLI by simply typing:
codex
Or directly give it a prompt, like:
codex "translate this Python function to JavaScript"

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want Codex CLI to auto-install any required dependencies, when running a prompt, use the parameters add ‚Äú--approval-mode full-auto‚Äù to the prompt, as in:
codex --approval-mode full-auto "create a modern recruitment app to register and evaluate job candidates"
